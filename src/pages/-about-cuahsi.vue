          HIS is a cyberinfrastructure project for real-time sensor data
          storage, retrieval, management and curation. It is a cloud-based,
          multi-organizational system, designed to support massive permanent
          monitoring efforts. We merge the QA/QC process with field maintenance
          and system status alerting in a way which makes it easier to keep on
          top of issues that crop up with the data.

          We are agnostic to datalogger and sensor type, as long as they produce
          a measurement with a timestamp.

          Also, while our backend primarily uses
          <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/" target="_blank">InfluxDB</a> for
          storage and retrieval, we can access data stored in other existing
          databases. Ingestion of data can be from static CSV files on a shared
          drive, realtime MQTT messaging, or
