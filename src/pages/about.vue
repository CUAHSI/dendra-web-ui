            <p class="subheading">
              Dendra is a cyberinfrastructure project for real-time sensor data
              storage, retrieval, management, and curation. It is a cloud-based,
              multi-organizational system, designed to support massive permanent
              monitoring efforts. The name is derived from dendritic networks,
              such as river networks or tree roots. Environmental monitoring
              performs in a similar manner, pulling data from the earthâ€™s
              surface to a single location.

              During our rollout, we may need to take Dendra offline for
              software upgrades and testing. Our regularly scheduled maintenance
              window is from 8 PM to 10 PM PST daily.
